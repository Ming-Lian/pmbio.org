### Key concepts 
* Somatic variation, variant types (SNVs, small indels, CNVs, SVs, LOH), VCFs, variant allele fraction (VAF), purity estimation and tumor clonality. [Lecture File: PMBIO_Module05_Somatic.pdf](/assets/lectures/PMBIO_Module05_Somatic.pdf)

### Learning objectives
* Compare and contrast the merits of exome and WGS data for variant calling
* Compare germline and somatic variant calling strategies
* Consider the features of major variant types detected in NGS data
* Perform somatic variant calling of various types using tools specific to each type
* Understand the basic features of the VCF format
* Merge multiple VCFs into a single combined VCF
* Perform variant filtering to identify a high quality set of variants
* Annotate variants with respect to transcript annotations, population frequency, predicted function, etc.
* Manually review variants of each type to better understand how variant callers use read alignment data to identify variants
