### Key concepts
* Sequence alignment algorithms, BAM files, genome viewers, alignment quality assessment. [Lecture File: PMBIO_Module03_Align.pdf](/assets/lectures/PMBIO_Module03_Align.pdf)

### Learning objectives
* Compare and contrast DNA vs. RNA sequence alignment strategies
* Perform alignment of sequence data using a few popular alignment algorithms
* Explore the BAM file format and learn approaches for summarizing, filtering, and otherwise manipulating BAM files
* Learn to use a genome viewer
* Perform a quality assessment using the aligned data
