# Introduction

There are a large number of tools and online resources that we use to help interpret cancer variants. We will explore just a few cancer interpretation tools in this section. A more comprehensive list of those that we commonly use is provided [below](#additional-useful-tools-and-resources-for-somatic-cancer-variant-interpretation).

<<<<<<< HEAD
# Process So Far

Steps below require you to begin with some list of variants in variant call format (```.vcf```). We will use the final merged, filtered somatic exome VCF from the [Somatic SNV and Indel Filtering and Annotation]("https://pmbio.org/module-05-somatic/0005/02/02/Somatic_SNV_and_Indel_Filtering_and_Annotation/") section. Recall that to generate this file, we merged variant calling from the VARSCAN, STRELKA, and MuTect2 programs. All three programs are designed to detect SNVs and small insertions, deletions, and indels. The merged variant file was then left-aligned and trimmed. Then variants were filtered and annotated with VEP.      

# Additional Filtering

Similar to germline variant interpretation, we can perform additional filtering in the VEP program:  

```bash
cd /workspace/somatic/
wget /V86_38_MUTANTCENSUS-breast.csv
cat V86_38_MUTANTCENSUS-breast.csv | cut -f1 -d , | uniq > breast-ca-gene-list.txt
filter_vep --format vcf -i /workspace/somatic/exome.annotated.vcf -o /workspace/somatic/tumor-exome-clinfilt.vcf --filter "(MAX_AF < 0.01 or not MAX_AF) and FILTER = PASS and SYMBOL in /workspace/somatic/breast-ca-gene-list.tex" --force_overwrite
cat exome.annotated.vcf | grep "^chr" | wc -l
cat tumor-exome-clinfilt.vcf | grep "^chr" | wc -l
```

* First, the ```cat V86_38_MUTANTCENSUS-breast.csv | cut -f1 -d , | uniq > breast-ca-gene-list.txt``` returns in ```breast-ca-gene-list.txt``` a unique list of genes found in clinical studies of breast cancer from the Cancer Gene Census (see below). Access to the census through COSMIC is free, but requires a login, so we provide the list for you on the course repository.

* Similar to genomic variant interpretation, the first VEP filter, "MAX_AF <0.01 or not MAX_AF", returns VCF lines where the variant population frequency is less than 0.01.

* "FILTER = PASS" selects VCF lines that passed previous quality filters. 

* And SYMBOL in /workspace/somatic/breast-ca-gene-list.tex will limit our results by the list of breast cancer genes from the Cancer Gene Census.

* Filtering reduced our variants of interest from 1,456 to 51. For a clinical sequencing study, this is a reasonable number of variants to carry forward to manual review.

### Exercise
Start with our final list of somatic variants and select a priority set.  For example, start with the variants here:
* /workspace/somatic/final/

Many of the resource below could be helpful in this exercise.
