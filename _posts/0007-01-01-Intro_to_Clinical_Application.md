### Key concepts
* Clinical interpretation of variants, variant interpretation types (predisposing, predictive, predisposing, diagnostic), variant interpretation guidelines, clinical applications of passenger somatic variants (early detection, minimal residual disease tracking, personalized vaccines).

### Learning objectives:
* Biological function or oncogenicity (demonstrate concepts by uploading a filtered VCF into CRAVAT)
* Germline pathogenicity assessment (demonstrate concepts with some example variants using ClinGen Variant Curation Interface)
* Somatic clinical actionability (demonstrate concepts with some example variants using CIViC)
