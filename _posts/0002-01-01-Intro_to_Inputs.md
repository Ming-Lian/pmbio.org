### Key concepts
* Central dogma (chromosomes, genes, transcripts, proteins), reference genome assemblies, reference genome versions, FASTA file format, gene/transcript annotation pipelines (Refseq, Ensembl, UCSC, Gencode), GTF file format, sequence data generation, NGS reads, FASTQ file format, raw data QC.

### Learning objectives
* Obtain reference genome and annotation files and understand the standard formats used to represent them
* Index large files for more efficient access/analysis
* Download and explore raw data files
* Review experimental details for a proof-of-principle personalized genomics exercise
* Perform a raw data quality assessment and discuss any data quality issues that are observed. What are their implications for interpretation of the results?
