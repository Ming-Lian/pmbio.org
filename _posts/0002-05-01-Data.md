### Data acknowledgement
First and foremost, we are extremely grateful to the patients who donate tumor samples for research and educational purposes such as this. Progress in disease research would not be possible without such contributions. These donations have helped to realize significant improvements in our understanding of cancer biology and improvements in cancer outcomes. For one of many great summaries of these advances, please refer to [Cancer - our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/cancer).

### About the data
Throughout the course we will use data from several sources, but many of the examples and exercises relate specifically to single cell line, chosen to represent a hypothetical patient. More precisely, we will use a well-described breast cancer cell line (HCC1395) and its matched lymphoblastoid cell line (HCC1395BL). The data are hosted on our server at [genomedata.org](http://genomedata.org/pmbio-workshop/fastqs/). The cell line itself can be obtained (with a nominal fee) from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), a nonprofit organization which collects, stores, and distributes standard reference microorganisms, cell lines and other materials for research and development ([citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATCC_(company))). Product pages for the HCC1395 cell lines can be found here: [HCC1395/CRL-2324](https://www.atcc.org/Products/All/CRL-2324.aspx), [HCC1395BL/CRL-2325](https://www.atcc.org/products/all/CRL-2325.aspx)). 

NOTE from ATCC: This cell line was deposited at the ATCC by Dr. Adi F. Gazdar and is provided for research purposes only. Neither the cell line nor products derived from it may be sold or used for commercial purposes. Nor can the cells be distributed to third parties for purposes of sale, or producing for sale, cells or their products. The cells are provided as service to the research community. 

The HCC1395 cell line was obtained from a 43 year old Caucasian female patient. The HCC1395 cell line is described as being of tissue orgin: mammary gland; breast/duct. The HCC1395BL cell line was created from a B lymphoblast that was tranformed by the EBV virus. The patient's cancer was described as: TNM stage I, grade 3, primary ductal carcinoma. This cell line was initiated in the 1990s from a patient with a family history of cancer (patient's mother had breast cancer). The cell line took 14 months to establish. The patient received chemotherapy prior to isolation of the tumor ([PMID: 9833771](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9833771)). This tumor is concidered “Triple-Negative” by classic typing and “Ductal Carcinoma” by histology. Otherwise it is one of those difficult to classify by expression-based molecular typing (likely "Claudin-Low" [PMID: 22003129](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22003129)). The tumor cell line is known to be polyploid.

The table below provides sample details for all samples. Note that the 'Readgroup ID' can be used to match downloaded files to these details.
