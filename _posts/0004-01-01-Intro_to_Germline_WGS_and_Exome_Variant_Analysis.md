### Key concepts
* Variation, germline mutation, polymorphism, SNPs, variant databases, germline variant calling, mechanisms of mutation, heterozygous vs. homozygous variants. [Lecture File: PMBIO_Module04_Germline.pdf](/assets/lectures/PMBIO_Module04_Germline.pdf)


### Learning objectives
* Use of the GATK tool kit for variant calling
* Perform basic germline variant filtering
* Compare single sample germline variant calling to cohort based calling
